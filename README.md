# How to run
Running the app locally does not require docker.

`npm install`  
`npm run dev`  

Then you should be able to open [localhost](http://localhost:8080)

---
To generate the blog index and rss feed files run:  
`npm run buildIndex`  

It is also contained in:  
`npm run build`  
Which creates the production build.
