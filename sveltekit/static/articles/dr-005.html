<h1>Artificially enhanced IDE&#39;s and side-quests</h1>
<p>I&#39;ve been seeing a lot about AI based IDE&#39;s like cursor and the new changes to vs-code, this gave me some inspiration to fix some things that have irked me about my website since I initially setup the blog. Markdown flavour and bundle-sizes. While the problem is not the most complex it is also something that I didn&#39;t want to fix because what I had worked well enough. And fixing it would be re-implementing something that already worked.</p>
<p>So I wanted to see if I could get this done quickly and less tedious work, while also learning at the effectivity of proper AI enabled IDE&#39;s.</p>
<p>First let&#39;s go deeper into what I was actually fixing afterwards I will explain how AI helped me to do this but also gave me a side-quest of fixing something I thought already worked.</p>
<h2>Markdown is not markdown</h2>
<p>Sure most things are the same when writing it but some features are not.<br>I tend to do my writing in <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> which supports a broad range of markdown, including a lot of nice to haves from Github flavoured markdown. Lets first take a look at some common markdown flavours that are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Markdown (Original)</li>
<li><a href="https://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)</a></li>
<li>Pandoc Markdown</li>
<li>Markdown Extra</li>
<li>RMarkdown</li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/editing-help">StackOverflow/StackExchange Markdown</a></li>
<li>Ghost Markdown</li>
<li>Notion Markdown</li>
<li>Obsidian Markdown</li>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown">VSCode Markdown</a></li>
<li>Hugo Markdown</li>
</ul>
<p>just to name a few, in most cases it doesn&#39;t really matter. Something I&#39;ve wanted since the inception of my blog is footnotes. Previously I was using either commonMark. Honestly I didn&#39;t look at flavours at all when initially implementing my blog and I just wanted to get something up and shipped. I really like markdown footnotes both for actual footnotes and to keep citations in blog articles. I started using them back during my master when making notes for my thesis and have like the workflow of them ever since. Even in my <a href="https://meerman.xyz/#/blog/dr-001">first blogpost</a> I wrote that it was something I wanted to implement later.<br>Later just ended up taking a bit more time, this is in large part me originally going with a lazy solution of trying to throw packages at the problem until I found one that works.</p>
<h2>Markdown processors</h2>
<p>So we have all the various flavours, then there&#39;s the reality that there various npm packages that wil help you render markdown but what flavour and what other features do they have? Do they integrate with the front-end framework you are using. I wanted to use YAML frontmatter for the metadata and be able to easily put the HTML into a svelte page.</p>
<p>This led to me to use two packages for different purposes. I used  <a href="https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it">markdown-it</a> <a href="https://github.com/jackfranklin/rollup-plugin-markdown">rollup-plugin-markdown</a> , one to generate HTML at compile time and the other so I could query the meta data using globs.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import articles from &#39;./articles/*.md&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>The articles object was a list of all my articles with metadata and YAML frontmatter<sup><a id="/blog/dr-005#footnote-ref-1" href="#/blog/dr-005#footnote-1" data-/blog/dr-005#footnote-ref aria-describedby="/blog/dr-005#footnote-label">1</a></sup>. And an HTML property which I could easily load into a webpage.</p>
<p>This structure allowed me to be very lazy in code to not have to make actual lists of the articles. I could just import the folder and render it as I saw fit.<br>What I didn&#39;t notice at the time is that the nice html property was getting compiled and saved as a html string in the JS bundle. Which is fine for one two maybe three articles, but it does not scale and creates a lot of bundle size creep.<br>And I do want to keep the website small and fast. If you&#39;re not reading an article it doesn&#39;t need to be on your device.</p>
<p><img src="assets/articles/dr-5/js_in_bundle.png" alt="HTML in JS bundle"></p>
<h2>Fixing it</h2>
<p>I asked cursor with the context of the whole project for a few things. I did this systematically and one thing at the time, but I started with asking it to generate a new javascript file that could create separate static html files at compile time.</p>
<p>This would fix the bundle size issue, for the cost of 1 async fetch request to the same server for opening an article.<br>But that happens less than loading the full bundle, so that trade-off is something I think is worth it.  Next I needed to change the actual blog overview page as I wanted to remove the import <code>*.md</code>. In the script I already have for generating the rss feed and json counter part I added some lines to make it generate a JS file that exposes the same metadata.<br>No need to do markdown parsing or imports, there is a JSON object with all the metadata available in code.</p>
<p><em>Should</em> be simple.<br>There are multiple things I have JSON structures for on this website, my skills but also my educational history and work experiences. Those were stored in the components so I asked cursor to abstract them out.</p>
<h2>Side-quest</h2>
<p>While doing this abstraction I asked cursor to do this.<br>So I created the new files and let cursor fill them and create related imports.<br>One of the imports had an incorrect capitalisation, which compiles fine on a macbook due to its filesystem.<br>My CI pipeline uses an Ubuntu docker image which does not work and gave me an error that the file could not be found.<br>Due to it being one letter off I kept reading past this mistake even though the error was relatively clear.</p>
<p>I managed solving it by copy pasting the filename even though I thought it was correct<sup><a id="/blog/dr-005#footnote-ref-2" href="#/blog/dr-005#footnote-2" data-/blog/dr-005#footnote-ref aria-describedby="/blog/dr-005#footnote-label">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>Thoughts on AI enhanced coding</h2>
<p>While the process did cause some issues that where easily missed and caused some very frustrating debugging time.<br>Fixing the markdown parsing which has been on my mind for a while probably wouldn&#39;t have happened without it.<br>These types of tools are still relatively new and are at various levels of maturity.<br>Currently I think that <a href="https://www.cursor.com/">https://www.cursor.com/</a> has quite a good UI compared to github co-pilot due to its ability to interact with all the projects files, moving around the editor rather than mainly staying in place and its speed.</p>
<p>I like the tools for doing boilerplate coding or things that would require heavy documentation reading. However not so much for figuring out the actual logic of the program. The former can speed up the process the latter can lead to different assumptions of what the code will do by the developer and the implementation. The tools are not magic and it&#39;s still early but they can be interesting to explore.</p>
