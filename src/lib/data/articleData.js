Styling content in Markdown is relatively simple if you know the syntax which I happen to already know.\r\nThere are many different choices in Markdown editors, I happen to use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for my own note taking which is a great editor for this purpose.\r\nPeople usually read blogs on webpages not by downloading Markdown files, a format on its own is not enough.\r\n\r\n### RSS feeds\r\nWith the changes in management at Twitter microblogging and normal blogging seem to have gotten some more growth.\r\nFor myself I'd rather consume short blog articles with deeper content than similar twitter threads.\r\nFor that reason I also want to make everything accessible through an RSS feed, as that is how I would like to consume the content.\r\nRSS feeds give people back the control rather than being at the whims of big tech algorithms.\r\nThe feed for this blog can be found [here](/feed.xml).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Solution a custom tech stack\r\nI already have a website I'm happy with, so I prefer to extend that instead of starting another thing which might not get finished.\r\nLuckily there are many libraries / software tools that can help with converting Markdown to HTML or other formats.\r\nThis will make it straightforward to implement a system that will turn the Markdown into webpages on my website.\r\nAny future limitations will be there because of choices I made, they can therefore be removed by some effort from my side.\r\nOr if I end up wanting to publish to alternate platforms, turning the Markdown into something that fits a different platform will probably not be too complex.\r\n\r\n### Initial plan\r\nUse some existing markdown converter to build html and serve that on my website.\r\nHowever, setting that up in the existing build pipeline seemed like a lot of more effort than implementing a Svelte markdown renderer.\r\nI looked into completely rebuilding my website as Svelte-kit so that I could have faster pre-rendered pages.\r\nHowever, that would make the project longer and make it less likely for me to actually finish it.\r\n\r\n>Perfect is the enemy of good ~ Voltaire\r\n\r\n\r\n### Building it\r\n\r\nAfter some googling I found an article that solved a similar problem [^1] rendering Markdown pages in a Svelte website.\r\nWell they used Svelte + Sapper so some modifications where required, however many other solutions I found used SvelteKit which is slightly different from my older Svelte SPA approach.\r\nBy using rollup-glob and a rollup Markdown plugin as shown below:\r\n```javascript\r\nimport markdown from '@jackfranklin/rollup-plugin-markdown'\r\nimport glob from 'rollup-plugin-glob'\r\n\r\nexport {\r\n    plugins: [\r\n\t   json(),\r\n\t   markdown(),\r\n\t   glob(),\r\n\t   svelte({...})\r\n    ],\r\n    ...\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am able to import Markdown files in Svelte components with file globs.

Often they exceed a invisible threshold people forget about.\n\nThe project expiry date, without outside forces or active progress you can quickly loose interest in a project.\nThis is something I never really thought about until Zack Freedman mentioned it in a video[^1]\nFor side-projects this is more likely to happen due to them often not having any outside forces such as deadlines or managers to push them forward.\nThis has happened to me many times because I don't take this into account when starting the project.\n\nWhen starting a new project I get distracted by all the fun possible technologies or new architecture patterns I could use.\nThe clock towards the expiry date then starts to run even though I don't consciously think about that.\nMost often these side-projects have a large amount of growth potential which I think is good, but I forget to put down initial constraints and a specific goal.\nThat makes it very easy to keep circling between things that interrest me without actually making any progress.\nI have many such projects in my personal project graveyard, where often I ran out of motivation while I did not have enough of a working project to keep going.\n\n### Why is it a problem?\nSo why does it matter that you don't finish these projects?\nFor one being able to finish projects is a valuable skill.\nBeing getting the project to a state where you can actually use it will lead you to hopefully use it.\nWhich in turn will show you the weak points and what can be improved to help the user experience.\nFinishing a project in one way or another also gives your mind room for creativity for other things.\nWhen wanting to work on something, these unfinished projects can still take up space in your mind.\nThe whole idea of finishing projects and why is described a lot more eloquently by Bre Pettis and Kio Stark in the [Cult of Done](https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13) Manifesto[^2]\n\n### What can we do to prevent this?\n\nSo how can we make sure we actually finish side-projects?\nThere are a few techniques I like to use to keep me on task.\n\n* Prepare\n* Cheat\n* Constrain / set a clear goal\n* Collaborate\n\nNow I'm going to explain these and how they help.\n\n1. Prepare\n\tThink about the architecture you want to use, what technologies you want to use. Write down a rough idea of the UX flow your project will have. So while preparing and choosing technologies how do you prevent on getting stuck with analysis paralysis? Recently I've been planning to work on a simple workout tracking app, but I still haven't started. I keep not deciding on a technology / changing my mind. Leading to me not starting on actually making the thing, which means I can't use it and don't get the experience of doing the project. I do this because I'm trying to prematurely optimize for scenarios which might never happen.\n2. Cheat\n   What do I mean by this? I don't mean plagiarise someone else's project and pretend its yours and be done with it. But take shortcuts where possible use existing components that solve a problem for you. Doing everything from scratch can be fun but quickly takes a lot of time. If there are specific things you want to learn I would recommend to do that for a specific thing in the project and focus on that. Then you can still get the thrill of making it yourself, while it can get integrated into a project that has a better chance at getting finished. Don't be afraid to start with some existing template and modify it to fit your project. Finally cheat by preparing before this project \"timer\" really starts.\n3. Constrain\n\tFocus on the MVP first and set time constraints in which you have to reach that point. Otherwise it becomes easy to spend extra time on details that don't matter. There will always be some expiry date on the project but by thinking you have forever you will spend time on the wrong things. Being conscious of deadlines will help you focus on what matters.\n4. Collaborate\n\tOne way to have significantly higher chance to get something working is collaborate. Have a friend or family member be involved, this can be in various ways. If you are building for someone else you will be motivated to give them this thing so they can use it. Alternatively working on something with someone else can be fun and motivating even if they're not a stakeholder.\n\n### To conclude\n\nBy using these techniques you are more likely to actually get side-projects projects done.\nAnd by giving yourself stakeholders and constraining your expected time to work on it, you are more likely to focus on the important things.\nNo more getting stuck with analysis paralysis on things that don't matter when you want to deliver something to someone or a deadline.\nPrepare upfront so there are fewer things to get stuck on when actually doing the work.\nRemember that it can be okay to take the easy way for certain parts as long as it helps you get to the goal, just remember to not cheat yourself out of the goal.\nWhen wanting to learn more about a specific topic make sure that the shortcuts you take take away from the learning you want to do.\nIt's also important to remember you can always come back to it later and building on top of something that works is more motivating (to me at least) than continuing on a half baked project I haven't worked on in 6 months.\n\nThere is no magic bullet that will prevent your projects from ending up in purgatory but these techniques have helped me to finish more than I did before.\n\n# Sources\n\n[^1]: Zack Freedman [How to Finish Your Weekend Projects in One Weekend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72a85tWOJVY)\n[^2]: The cult of done [Manifesto](https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13)",

Leading to me not starting on actually making the thing, which means I can't use it and don't get the experience of doing the project. I do this because I'm trying to prematurely optimize for scenarios which might never happen.\n2. Cheat\n   What do I mean by this? I don't mean plagiarise someone else's project and pretend its yours and be done with it. But take shortcuts where possible use existing components that solve a problem for you. Doing everything from scratch can be fun but quickly takes a lot of time. If there are specific things you want to learn I would recommend to do that for a specific thing in the project and focus on that. Then you can still get the thrill of making it yourself, while it can get integrated into a project that has a better chance at getting finished. Don't be afraid to start with some existing template and modify it to fit your project. Finally cheat by preparing before this project \"timer\" really starts.\n3. Constrain\n\tFocus on the MVP first and set time constraints in which you have to reach that point. Otherwise it becomes easy to spend extra time on details that don't matter. There will always be some expiry date on the project but by thinking you have forever you will spend time on the wrong things. Being conscious of deadlines will help you focus on what matters.\n4. Collaborate\n\tOne way to have significantly higher chance to get something working is collaborate. Have a friend or family member be involved, this can be in various ways. If you are building for someone else you will be motivated to give them this thing so they can use it. Alternatively working on something with someone else can be fun and motivating even if they're not a stakeholder.\n\n### To conclude\n\nBy using these techniques you are more likely to actually get side-projects projects done.\nAnd by giving yourself stakeholders and constraining your expected time to work on it, you are more likely to focus on the important things.\nNo more getting stuck with analysis paralysis on things that don't matter when you want to deliver something to someone or a deadline.\nPrepare upfront so there are fewer things to get stuck on when actually doing the work.\nRemember that it can be okay to take the easy way for certain parts as long as it helps you get to the goal, just remember to not cheat yourself out of the goal.\nWhen wanting to learn more about a specific topic make sure that the shortcuts you take take away from the learning you want to do.\nIt's also important to remember you can always come back to it later and building on top of something that works is more motivating (to me at least) than continuing on a half baked project I haven't worked on in 6 months.\n\nThere is no magic bullet that will prevent your projects from ending up in purgatory but these techniques have helped me to finish more than I did before.\n\n# Sources\n\n[^1]: Zack Freedman [How to Finish Your Weekend Projects in One Weekend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72a85tWOJVY)\n[^2]: The cult of done [Manifesto](https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13)",

    "summary": "This article explores the common issue of unfinished side projects and suggests techniques to overcome it. The author discusses the challenge of side projects losing momentum over time due to the absence of external pressures like deadlines. They emphasize the importance of completing projects, as it hones valuable skills, allows for user feedback, and frees up mental space for creativity. The 'Cult of Done Manifesto' is referenced to underscore the significance of finishing. To prevent projects from languishing, the author recommends preparation, cheating by using existing components, setting clear goals, and collaborating with others. These strategies help maintain focus, enhance productivity, and increase the likelihood of project completion. Ultimately, the article acknowledges that there is no foolproof solution but suggests that these techniques have proven effective for the author in finishing more projects.",

Markdown flavour and bundle-sizes. While the problem is not the most complex it is also something that I didn't want to fix because what I had worked well enough. And fixing it would be re-implementing something that already worked.\n\nSo I wanted to see if I could get this done quickly and less tedious work, while also learning at the effectivity of proper AI enabled IDE's.\n\nFirst let's go deeper into what I was actually fixing afterwards I will explain how AI helped me to do this but also gave me a side-quest of fixing something I thought already worked.\n\n## Markdown is not markdown\nSure most things are the same when writing it but some features are not.\nI tend to do my writing in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) which supports a broad range of markdown, including a lot of nice to haves from Github flavoured markdown. Lets first take a look at some common markdown flavours that are available:\n\n- Standard Markdown (Original)\n- [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)\n- [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/)\n- Pandoc Markdown\n- Markdown Extra\n- RMarkdown\n- [StackOverflow/StackExchange Markdown](https://stackoverflow.com/editing-help)\n- Ghost Markdown\n- Notion Markdown\n- Obsidian Markdown\n- [VSCode Markdown](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown)\n- Hugo Markdown\n\njust to name a few, in most cases it doesn't really matter. Something I've wanted since the inception of my blog is footnotes. Previously I was using either commonMark. Honestly I didn't look at flavours at all when initially implementing my blog and I just wanted to get something up and shipped.

Markdown flavour and bundle-sizes. While the problem is not the most complex it is also something that I didn't want to fix because what I had worked well enough. And fixing it would be re-implementing something that already worked.\n\nSo I wanted to see if I could get this done quickly and less tedious work, while also learning at the effectivity of proper AI enabled IDE's.\n\nFirst let's go deeper into what I was actually fixing afterwards I will explain how AI helped me to do this but also gave me a side-quest of fixing something I thought already worked.\n\n## Markdown is not markdown\nSure most things are the same when writing it but some features are not.\nI tend to do my writing in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) which supports a broad range of markdown, including a lot of nice to haves from Github flavoured markdown. Lets first take a look at some common markdown flavours that are available:\n\n- Standard Markdown (Original)\n- [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)\n- [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/)\n- Pandoc Markdown\n- Markdown Extra\n- RMarkdown\n- [StackOverflow/StackExchange Markdown](https://stackoverflow.com/editing-help)\n- Ghost Markdown\n- Notion Markdown\n- Obsidian Markdown\n- [VSCode Markdown](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown)\n- Hugo Markdown\n\njust to name a few, in most cases it doesn't really matter. Something I've wanted since the inception of my blog is footnotes. Previously I was using either commonMark. Honestly I didn't look at flavours at all when initially implementing my blog and I just wanted to get something up and shipped. I really like markdown footnotes both for actual footnotes and to keep citations in blog articles. I started using them back during my master when making notes for my thesis and have like the workflow of them ever since. Even in my [first blogpost](https://meerman.xyz/#/blog/dr-001) I wrote that it was something I wanted to implement later.\nLater just ended up taking a bit more time, this is in large part me originally going with a lazy solution of trying to throw packages at the problem until I found one that works.\n\n## Markdown processors\nSo we have all the various flavours, then there's the reality that there various npm packages that wil help you render markdown but what flavour and what other features do they have?

Growing competition within AI coding tools, models, even protocols now it seems. With Google [announcing](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/) their Agent2Agent protocol.\n\nI'm liking these open standards, allowing you to pick your own models and tools and use them in complexer ways; to do more than just simple gimmicks and with less hallucinations. So with all the movement in the space and Gemini 2.5 pro still being free in preview and GPT 4.1 dropping which is also more focussed on tool use. It got me excited to try and experiment with this new technology.\n\nI have been working with the ServiceNow platform for a long time so a simple and useful thing that popped into my mind is a tool to retrieve table schemas. (Fully original thoughts, not because the VS Code agentic mode video showed the same idea but for Postgres)\n\nYou can find the MCP server I created on [Github](https://github.com/DriesMeerman/sn-dev-mcp).\n\n# What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)\nFor an indepth explanation I can recommend their [documentation website](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) I got a lot of my information while working on this project from there.\nI understand the protocol as follows, we have a model some Large Language Model (LLM) and it needs additional context to do something (without hallucinating, or asking the user). A simple example is databas schema's you are asking the model for some help with an SQL query, but it doesn't know what your table looks like.\nMCP is just a standardised way for the LLM to keep working and request this information so it can act upon it.\n\n![mcp no tool structure](./mcp_no_tool_structure.png)\n\nThese diagrams show an example of steps that would get moved to the tool. Because the tools supply \"real\" data the accuracy / usefulness should be better than if its based on memory and requires less manual interaction.\n\n![mcp with tool structure](./mcp_with_tool_structure.png)\n\n\nAdditionally it can also allow your computer to do things instructed by the LLM while still having a layer of safety. For example when your AI powered editor asks to NPM install something, which can then be done by just accepting the tool use. It doesn't give the LLM power to do anything and it gets an answer on the success of it keeping context of what is happening.\n\n# Building an MCP Server\nIf you are serious about building an MCP yourself you should follow the official [quickstart guide for server developers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server#node). Alongside this there is a nice collection of [reference MCP servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) on Github.\nSo lets assume you did follow the guide and your project builds. How do you run it locally / actually test it?\n\n> *Use the model inspector*\n\nI did it with Node but python should be similar.\n\n```bash\nnpm run build && \\\nnpx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node $(pwd)/dist/index.js \\\n--connection-string https://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@<INSTANCE>.service-now.com\n```\n\nSo lets break that command down. First we build the MCP server, then we run the inspector. The inspector takes as parameter a string to start the server, so I'm assuming python would work just as well as node here. A full file path to the output of the MCP server, followed by its arguments. Which in my case are named even though the only options is a connection string, containing username password and host.\n\nThis starts the inspector which has a nice web UI, which in turn starts the MCP server. If you use claude code, vs code, cursor or something else that will be starting the MCP server.\n\nThe inspector is a lot easier during development though, as **you** can be the LLM you've always wanted to be; that uses the tools. Its also nice you don't have to burn through tokens to get an LLM to use your tool for dev purposes.\n\nThe inspector feels similar like a Postman or Insomnia[^1].\n![mcp_inspector](./mcp_inspector.png)\n\nIt has clear in an outputs and you see immediatly whether your tool / resource is working or not. Which you define as part of adherence to the protocol, which is how the LLMs are able to communicate with it.\n\nThe arguments past `node path/to/script.js` are arguments handled in the implementation of the MCP Server.\n\n# What now\nSo what does this all lead to? Hopefully a functioning MCP server, that you can add to a MCP client. Examples of this are some IDE's like VS Code and Cursor, but also Claude code. Look at your client's documentation for the exact specifics, I will explain it for Cursor as that is what I used.\n\n1. Have the repo locally[^2]\n2. Open its project folder and `npm install`\n3. Build the project: `npm run build`\n4. Open the project where you want to use the tool\n5. Create `.cursor/mcp.json` and add the following content\n\t Make sure to replace the placeholders\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"mcp-sn\": {\n            \"command\": \"node\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"/path/to/your/mcp-sn/dist/index.js\",\n                \"--connection-string\",\n                \"https://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@<INSTANCE>.service-now.com\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see this is very similar to the arguments we passed to the inspector only in a slightly different format.\nNow open your cursor settings and enable the mcp server\n\n![Cursor settings](./cursor_settings.png)\nHopefully we get a nice green dot showing its working.\n![MCP active](./mcp_active.png)\n\n\n# Result\nNow you can try a request in the agent chat mode and get live data from the ServiceNow instance you are connected too.\nFor example as shown here:\n\n![cursor mcp sn task](./cursor_mcp_sn_task.png)\n\nThe video[^3] below shows a demo creating a custom table and letting an LLM create scripts to query that table.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dcxhYRUoqpg\" title=\"Model context protocol - LLM interacting with custom ServiceNow Table\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br/>\n\n\n# Closing thoughts\nFor a new protocol the documentation and existing knowledge on it is quite good and allows you to get started and get something up and running fast.\n\nIt does require existing knowledge of LLMs and knowing how REST API's work is a big plus.\n\nI think this space is still getting started and I'm curious to see what kind of tools will become available in the short and long term.

Deep dive interesting topics, when you find an interesting rabbit hole dig in!\n3. Don't be afraid of doing things or life will pass you by.\n4. Drink sparkling water instead of soda.\n5. Focus not on what happened and why it limits your options, but what actions you can take.\n6. Express your creativity, the medium doesn't matter as long as you go out and create.\n7. Reflect on yourself and write it down on paper with a pen.\n\tUsing pen and paper forces you to slow down your thinking as your hand can't keep up, this will make you contemplate what you are writing down more.\n8. Whole-ass the things you do.\n9. Do your holiday gift shopping early.\n10. Do *Weird* things unordinary things make for fun memories, good weird like going on an last minute trip instead of not going because its against the norm.\n11. Find some form of exercise that you enjoy it can also be something with habit stacking, for me its going to the gym while listening to podcasts \\[[unmade](https://unmade.fm), [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex)\\].\n12. In your career take jobs to **learn** or **earn** otherwise keep trying to grow towards those. Try not to stick around when things get stagnent but when you earn, you can spend energy on other avenues.\n13. Be critical of ideas both your own and others, but stay open to them.\n    *Strong opinions loosely held*\n14. Consistently show up, frequency is experience, experience leads to quality.\n15. Be in the moment by trying to enjoy whatever you're doing 10% more.\n16. Sometimes its better to grow your strengths rather than trying to improve your weaknesses.\n17. Ask yourself if what you are doing is the optimal thing, is it something you are enjoying? If not you've got better things to do and you know what they are.\n18. Go to events related to your interests life is all about the experiences you make\n19. Don't fear advanced tools as they can be very useful, but don't depend on them to do the work for you.\n20. Make video records of things you have made, cool things you made at work or for your hobbies. In years when memories fade it can be fun to look back on.\n21. You can create your own luck by working hard and being ready when opportunity strikes\n22. Engaged creation gives purpose so find your thing, it can be anything as long as its you creating it and you enjoying the process of the creation.\n23. Give yourself permission to create even if it's not the \"right\" way, if everyone only follows the same practices then innovation will stop.\n24. If you have the space go where your interests take you, don't force yourself to keep working on a project you can always pause and come back to it. Working with motivation will get you results faster although you don't always have the luxury to choose.\n25. Sleeping enough, getting some exercise, getting sun and socializing with friends. It's common advice but it really does wonders for your sanity.\n26. To achieve your goals setup systems don't assume you will get there on vibes only. Without a system a bad day can break a pattern of progress.\n27. When a choice feels so painful that you attempt to default to inaction, **DO NOT** allow yourself to not also feel the implication of the inaction, that can just leave you in a bad situation longer.\n28. Take a step back and try to look at yourself from a third person perspective to try and see both the good and bad from an outside perspective.\n29. Spread investments (if you have any) into multiple avenues to spread the risk. Also investing a little consistently monthly or quarterly will help you build up for the future.\n30. Action creates motivation, don't wait and don't continuously stop you will lose the power of momentum.\n\n---\n\n![Abstract ideas](./ideas-abstract.png)\n\n---\n\n\n# Sources\n\n[32 ways to be better at life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vobLTc8Zd1Q)\n\n[68 bits of unsolicited advice from Kevin Kelly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz70rcguxwk)\n",
