author: Dries Meerman
summary: Swift 5.9, released with Xcode 15.2, introduces significant language improvements, including bi-directional C++ compatibility, macros, and the use of 'if' and 'switch' as expressions for more readable code. Debugging sees a speed boost, particularly in 'p' and 'po' commands, and there are notable enhancements to the Swift Package Manager and the Swift-syntax project. The author is particularly excited about the potential for cleaner code with 'if' expressions and the anticipated improvements in code analysis tools. This update also brings advancements for Swift on Windows platforms.

# Swift 5.9 TL;DR
As a mobile architect and developer for the [4Industry](https://4industry.io) iOS app, my daily work revolves around reading and writing a lot of Swift. 
This year I want to improve my expertise, particularly by diving deeper into the evolving landscape of Swift.
Instead of learning about language changes due to compiler errors from updating XCode to a new major version and the associated Swift language level, I want to stay ahead learn about the features so I can start using them.

Xcode 15.2 with Swift 5.9 just released so I decided to write a TL;DR[^1] on the main new features.
For a complete list read the official blog article [here]([https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-5.9-released/](https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-5.9-released/ "https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-5.9-released/").

# Language Improvements
- Bi-directional compatibility with c++
- ⁠[Macros](https://medium.com/@ezgiustunel/swift-5-9-macros-5d2884f6ece7#:~:text=by%20Aaron%20Burden-,We%20met%20Macros%20with%20Swift%205.9.,cannot%20see%20in%20compile%20time.

- ⁠[Parameter packs](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/value-and-type-parameter-packs/ "https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/value-and-type-parameter-packs/")  
    Generic methods with arbitrary param count
- If and switch as expressions  
```swift
statusBar.text = if !hasConnection { "Disconnected" }
                 else if let error = lastError { errorlocalizedDescription }
                 else { "Ready" }
```
- Debugging improvements  
[p and po](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28806423/whats-the-difference-between-p-and-po-in-xcodes-lldb-debugger "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28806423/whats-the-difference-between-p-and-po-in-xcodes-lldb-debugger") speed increase
- Swift package manager improvements
- Improvements to [Swift-syntax project](https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax)  
- Windows platform improvements


# Closing thoughts
I think I'm most excited to start using the if expressions, to make some code a bit more readable. And possibly in some cases replace var statements with let's. I hope the improvements to the syntax project will add new capabilities the Swift code analysis tools. Finally any debugger speed improvements are always appreciated, `po` in some of my usecases can feel sluggish at times.
