        I'm a software engineer interested in solving complex problems.
        Frameworks, programming languages and other tools are not goals in themselves for me but rather a means to solve problems.
        Problems I really enjoy solving is the automation of tedious tasks, removing manual repetitive tasks from peoples lives.
        When solving problems I like to be involved, I don't enjoy writing code without some creativity to solve a problem being involved.<br/>
        Outside of professional environments I've got a wide interest in technology from gadgets to hardware and software.
        I also enjoy longboarding, video games and working on my physical fitness.
