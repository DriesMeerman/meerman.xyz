        I'm a software engineer interested in solving complex problems.
        Frameworks and programming languages and other techniques are tools not goals in themselves.
        When solving problems I like to be involved, I don't enjoy writing code just because that I'm told to; I want to stand behind what I build. <br/>
        Outside of professional environments I've got interests in technology from gadgets to hardware and software.
        I also enjoy longboarding, video games and going to the gym.
        Due to my wide interest I've got experience with quite a few technologies.
